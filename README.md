🔥[2025-12]: We released our paper, benchmark, and evaluation codes.

## Introduction

<!-- ![Teaser](assets/teaser.jpg) -->

Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce **MMSI-Video-Bench**, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

## Features of MMSI-Video-Bench

- **High quality.** All data are manually annotated by 11 domain experts in 3D vision, following a rigorous review and acceptance process to ensure annotation accuracy and reliability.

- **Challenging.** We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human–AI gap, even the best reasoning model trails human performance by nearly 60%.

- **Diverse Video Sources.** MMSI-Video-Bench includes videos from 25 public datasets and 1 in-house collection, spanning tabletop recordings, indoor and multi-floor environments, outdoor scenes, sports, and movie footage.

- **Comprehensive and Hostile Task Coverage.** The benchmark covers spatial layout reasoning, motion understanding, decision-making, and cross-video reasoning, providing a more holistic evaluation of video-based spatial intelligence.



## Example

The questions in MMSI-VIdeo-Bench span 5 major categories: **(1).Spatial Construction**：This category focuses on spatial attributes of instances and scenes, as well as spatial relationships among instances, scenes, and cameras (six subtypes in total); **(2).Motion Understanding**:
This includes understanding camera motion, instance motion, and interactive motion between instances; **(3).Planning** based on spatiotemporal video information;  **(4).Prediction**: Assessing a model’s ability to predict, anticipate, or imagine future states based on the observed video; **(5).Cross-Video Reasoning**: This involves memory update across temporally separated video segments and multi-view integration across videos captured from different viewpoints.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone Github repo.

2. Install requirements.

   ```shell
   conda activate your_env_name
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note:* If you want to evaluate open-source models, you need to set up their corresponding environments.

### Data Preparation

  Download the MMSI-Video-Bench data from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rbler/MMSI-Video-Bench). The dataset includes:

(1) Annotations: `mmsivideo.json`.

(2) Reference images for questions: `ref_images.zip`.

(3) Video frames: `frames.zip`.

(Optional) Original video files: `videos.zip`.

After downloading, unzip the files and organize them as follows:

  ```
  |-data/
  |-- mmsivideo.json
  |-- frames/
  |-- ref_images/
  |-- videos/
  ```

  For more detail about the json-format data, refer to [documention](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rbler/MMSI-Video-Bench).

## 👓 Evaluation

Please note that while **Sufficient Coverage** ensures that all video information is fully preserved, we **Recommend** using this setting for evaluation.
Evaluation under the **Uniform** setting may lead to missing critical information. The Uniform-50 setting is only provided due to current input-length limitations in some models.

1. Run infernece

    For open-source models, change the openai `base_url` and `api_key` to your own in `utils/openai_api.py`. For proprietary models, modify the `load_model` function in `inference.py` to use the corresponding model path. Run the following command to perform inference for a specific model under a particular setting:
    ```python
    python inference.py --model_name {model_name} --setting Uniform-50/Sufficient-Coverage
    ```

2. Run evaluation
   
   Run the following command to obtain scores for a specific benchmark. The default is the main benchmark.

   ```python
    python evaluation.py --eval_dir {path/to/results} --bench main/robot_bench/ground_bench/indoor_perception_bench/easy2hard_bench
    ```
